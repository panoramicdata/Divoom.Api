This is a .NET library for controlling Divoom Timebox devices.

It is based on the [Divoom Timebox API](http://doc.divoom-gz.com/web/#/12?page_id=189).

We only have access to the following devices at present, so these are the only onces we can develop against:
* PIXOO64
* Timebox Evo (16x16)

Gratefully received:
* Documentation
* Devices (ship to Panoramic House, 46 Heywood Avenue, SL6 3JA, UK)
* Amazon **UK** vouchers to buy devices
* Hints
* Findings
* Bluetooth logs
